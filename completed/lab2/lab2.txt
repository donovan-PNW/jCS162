1) Changed mistyped variable on lines 19 and 41 from 'determinGrade()' to 'determineGrade()'

2) Added #include <cstring> library to enable strcpy() functions

3) Removed semicolon from line 53, which was causing the final "if" condition to exit early 
and setting the program to change char grade to 'C' no matter what.


hellomake: app.cpp
